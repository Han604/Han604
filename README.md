Dual wield full-stack developer + fashion designer, nice to meet you my name is Eric.

I've been doing eng for 5+ years starting with a bootcamp at Concordia University with a FE focus. I've cut my teeth at start-up Arina.Live as a junior and freelanced actively with Boston Chinatown Community Land Trust for their Immigrant History Trail as their sole dev. I've been working at Greenshield Labs in Toronto for the past 2+ years as SD III as a NextJS + TypeScript + Ruby on Rails + PostgreSQL.

I also have a diploma of fashion design from LaSalle College, Vancouver campus and have been working on my ready-to-wear line PILLAR (@pillarbrand on ig) actively for 1+ years.

With my design background I've found myself a natural pixel pusher, that's the easy part. The logic and system portion of the back end: API, db, test-cases, microservices, that's the good stuff. Pattern drafting and code, it really tickles the same part of the brain.

here's some of the tech I've been working with:
React + Typescript + NextJS + Jest + storybook
NodeJS + Express + Mongo
Postgres + Ruby on rails
